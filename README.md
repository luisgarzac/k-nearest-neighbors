# **k-nearest-neighbors**

We implemented the KNN algorithm for classification problems using Python. The algorithm is based on finding the k nearest neighbors to an unknown object in the training dataset, and classifying the unknown object based on the majority of labels of the nearby neighbors.



> Code T9-1 : Project made with the breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset where we have several characteristics representing values corresponding to patients. We applied the k-nearest-neighbors technique to the data to classify whether it corresponds to a patient with 2 for benign or 4 for malignant for cancer detection. 


> Code T9-2 : In the k_nearest_neighbors function, we implemented the mathematics to create our own KNN and apply it to the breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset. We achieved an accuracy above 0.95.

> Code T9-3 : Using the MovieLens dataset consisting of 100,000 ratings, we conducted an exploratory data analysis with the goal of creating a movie recommendation system through collaborative filtering based on users, KNN, and items.
